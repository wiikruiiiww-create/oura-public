//! Usage tracking for NIP-AM agent turn metrics.
//!
//! Agents that support usage reporting emit a `_goose/unstable/session/update`
//! notification (with `sessionUpdate: "usage_update"`) at the end of every
//! turn.  Both goose and buzz-agent use this same wire format.  The payload
//! carries session-cumulative token counts from which we derive per-turn
//! deltas.
//!
//! # Delta computation
//!
//! Because goose only reports cumulative counters, the per-turn counts are
//! computed as `current − previous`. Three cases require special handling per
//! NIP-AM:
//!
//! 1. **First turn (no prior baseline):** delta unknown → `null` counts,
//!    `delta_reliable: false`.
//! 2. **Counter decrease** (harness restart, overflow): delta would be
//!    negative → `null` counts, `delta_reliable: false`.
//! 3. **Session restart** (caller supplies a new `session_id` not seen
//!    before): treated as case 1 — fresh baseline, no delta for this turn.
//!
//! Goose may emit **multiple** `usage_update` notifications per turn. The
//! tracker handles this correctly: the committed baseline (and `turn_seq`)
//! advance only when `take()` is called (i.e. at publish time), never on
//! individual notifications. Within a turn all notifications measure their
//! delta from the same frozen baseline — the end of the previous published
//! turn — so the final `pending` record always reflects the full
//! previous-published→current-final delta regardless of how many
//! intermediate notifications arrived.
//!
//! The `TurnUsage` produced after each turn is consumed by the
//! `TurnCompletionGuard` in `pool.rs` to publish a kind 44200 relay event.
